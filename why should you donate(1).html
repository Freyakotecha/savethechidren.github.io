<h1 style="margin: 0cm; margin-bottom: .0001pt">Why should you donate ?</h1>
<h3>1. A feeling of purpose</h3>
<h4 class="auto-style1">Those who give to charity are also participating in a 
cause that is larger and more significant than themselves. People don’t need to 
participate in volunteerism to give back – giving to a charitable cause is an 
equally significant way in helping an organisation make a difference and provide 
aid to the needy.</h4>
<h3>2. The ability to make a difference</h3>
<h4><span class="auto-style1">Even the smallest of donations can make a big 
impact. NGOs like Save the Children have highly cost-efficient programs, which 
are able to channelize the value of every single rupee towards helping the 
marginalised and impoverished across India</span>. </h4>
<h3>3. Donation tax rebate</h3>
<h4 class="auto-style1">Along with participating in an important social cause, 
you receive the additional benefits of donations being tax deductible. </h4>
